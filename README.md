To export the online tickets within an isotope document (e.g. the invoice), simple modify the `iso_document_….html5`.
Add the following lines to the end of the template file.

```php
<?php if (null !== ($objTickets = Internethering\Isotope\OnlineTickets\Model\Ticket::findByOrder($this->collection->id))): ?><div style="font-size: 72.5%; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif; float:left; page-break-before:always;">

        echo $arrBillingAddress->street_2 ? $arrBillingAddress->street_2 . "<br>" : "";
        echo $arrBillingAddress->street_3 ? $arrBillingAddress->street_3 . "<br>" : "";
        echo $arrBillingAddress->postal . " ";
        echo $arrBillingAddress->city . "<br><br>"; ?></td>
  	  </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="border-bottom: 2px solid #c8c8c8;">&nbsp;</td>

    <?php endwhile; ?>
  </table>
</div><?php endif; ?>

### Personalize hard tickets

There are two supported cases for selling identifiable hard tickets:

#### Hard tickets have a white cut-out

Imagine you order hard tickets for you event. You can design it however you want to. You just need to leave a white
cut-out on the ticket, where you can print the barcode on.

In the Contao backend, go to "Events". Configure the current event and click on "Pre printed tickets". Now you enter the
facts of your ticket:
1) The width and height of one single hard ticket
2) The elements you want to print on the ticket, most likely the barcode and/or ticket number. Therefore you have to
enter the position of the white cut-out of your hard ticket as x- and y-coordinate in millimeters.
3) Specify the font to use (for the ticket number) and the size of the QR-Code, barcode etc.

Now, you are supposed to create a new Agency ("Vorverkaufsstelle"). Define, how many tickets they get to sell. Then
click on the button "export pdf" for the particular agency. You get a pdf with the size and elements defined before.
Place your hard tickets in the printer and print the pdf.

#### Self-printed tickets

Imagine you want to print the hard tickets on your own, because you only print a few or don't use that much color, so
that ordered hard tickets of a print shop are not profitable.

After you created an event, create a new Agency ("Vorverkaufsstelle"). Define, how many tickets they get to sell. Then
click on the button "export" for the particular agency. You will get the ticket numbers and bar codes as a CSV-file. Now
the best idea is to download a "Code 3 of 9 font". Install this font on your computer. Then create a new InDesign
document and design your ticket. Cut-out the barcode. Now you use InDesigns function of "Datenzusammenführung", to load
the CSV file within InDesign and create identifiable tickets. Print them.

### Usage of the TicketPay app

You need to point the url `https://api.ticketpay.de/` to your contao installation.
Then you can log in with your contao credentials. The events, orders and tickets will get fetched via this url and you
are ready to perform the checkin.

To check the entrypoint is configured properly, you can request
`https://api.ticketpay.de/api/userLogin?username=test&password=test` and should get the message:

```json
{"Errorcode":1,"Errormessage":"Unbekanntes Terminal"}
```
